# Badass functions
Anytime I find or develop a cool function/script to speed up my work or to avoid boring coding - I will put them in here!

### Benchmark your computer/laptop for coding performance:

 - **Description:** This code executes a benchmarking test using the `benchmark_std` function, where the test is repeated three times. Setting `verbose = TRUE` provides detailed output during execution, while `cores = 0L` enables the use of all available CPU cores for maximum parallel processing. After completing the benchmark, plot(res) visualizes the results, typically displaying performance metrics for the tested code or functions across the runs.
 - **Script name:** `benchmark-my-pc-performance.R`
 - **Language:** `R`
